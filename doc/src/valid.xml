		<title>Overview</title>
		This chapter contains a user guide and tutorial for the
		ValidateSearch program. The ValidateSearch program has been
		designed take the results of the SearchSystem that used
		automorphisms and expands each of the representatives and uses
		these permutations to construct the proposed code.

			<title>Running the Program</title>
			To run the program enter the following command followed by
			the flag, variable pairs described in the previous section.
			<programlisting format="linespecific">
				<![CDATA[
$ java -jar CS4099_MajorSP_validate.jar -f<name of results file> 
			]]>
			</programlisting>
			When the program is running the console will display the
			current progress of the validation. Once the program has
			finished validating the results it will display at the end
			the final results of the validation. The programs progress
			will also be found in the console output and a file named
			log.txt

		<title>Tutorial</title>
		In this tutorial we will use the ValidateSearch program to
		validate the results of a search that produced the
		<literal>6,5</literal>
		code. The results of the search is located in the file called
		<literal>results.xml</literal>
		, the contents of which can be found in the Tutorial for the
		ResultsTransformer. We enter name of the file into the program
		as follows:
		<programlisting format="linespecific">
			<![CDATA[
$ java -jar CS4099_MajorSP_validate.jar -fresults.xml
			]]>
		</programlisting>
		From this we expect to see the following console output that
		details the transformation process.
