		As part of the CS4099 Major Software Project module, a program
		called SearchSystem was developed that allowed the user to
		construct a Permutation Code using a list generated by a related
		GAP program. Two support programs were also created that allowed
		the user to validate the results of the SearchSystem. This
		document contains the following documentation for each of the
		aforementioned programs: Quick Guide, Installation Guide, User
		Guide, Tutorials and maintenance document.
